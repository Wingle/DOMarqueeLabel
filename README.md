DOMarqueeLabel
==============

This is a small API for a scrolling marquee label. I have simplified the code so that only an init and addSubview line of code is required. I have created three preset behaviors for the marquees:

-scrolling from right to left
-scrolling up into the frame and then to the left after a 0.5 second delay
-scrolling down into the frame and then to the left after a 0.5 second delay

I hope you enjoy using it! Comments for improvement are welcome.
